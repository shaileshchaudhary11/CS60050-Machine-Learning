# Predict Behavior using Support Vector Machines

## Library Used
    
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-learn(for report comparision)
6. math
7. operator
8. csv

## Operation performed

1. Removing Spaces from Column Names in the Dataset
2. Removing Object datatype Columns from the Dataset as these are not important for Principal Component Analysis. Labels are also removed as they are also not important in PCA.
3. Randomly split dataset into train, validation and test part. The ratio of the train, validation and test splits will be 70 : 10 : 20.
4. Principal Component Analysis
5. Comparison of my PCA Plot with the inbuilt PCA Available in sklearn
6. Implementation of SVM

## Step to run code

1. Open the terminal and nevigate to the folder where the code is present
2. Open the file name 'Group15_PBSVM.ipynb' using Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the code cell by cell
